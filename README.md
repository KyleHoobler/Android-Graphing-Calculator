Android-Graphing-Calculator
This is a WIP android graphing calculator that was developed for my CPSC 498 class.

This project will perform the following:

  Handle complex math equations using an object oriented design approach.
  
  Save formulas that users will be able to enter values for.
  
  Graph entered equations.
  
This is a scientific calculator that can solve equations based on user input. This is a solution to the regular calculator application on android that does not provide the ability to save formulas and also cannot graph them. This project is currently under development, but is currently feature complete. Currently I am working to fix bugs and add minor improvements to my code as well as improve code quality.
